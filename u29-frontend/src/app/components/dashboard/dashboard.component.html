  <h1>Innovation: Commercial Perovskite-Silicon Tandem Solar Panels</h1>

    <h3>Topic Summary</h3>
    <p>
      In September 2024, a major milestone in clean energy was reached as Oxford PV commenced the world’s first commercial shipment of perovskite-silicon tandem solar modules to U.S. customers. Unlike traditional solar panels that use a single layer of silicon, these new "tandem" cells stack a perovskite layer on top of a silicon layer. This allows the panel to capture a broader spectrum of light, significantly increasing efficiency.

      The commercially shipped modules boast a conversion efficiency of 24.5%, which is notably higher than the 20–22% efficiency typical of standard silicon panels. Furthermore, the company has already demonstrated record-breaking module efficiencies of 26.9% in residential-sized formats. This technology promises to generate up to 20% more power from the same surface area, reducing the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and optimizing land use for utility-scale projects. This innovation marks the transition of perovskite technology from a laboratory concept to a commercially viable product, paving the way for a future where solar installations are significantly more powerful and cost-effective.
